# Start of my Presentation

### This is an opening slide

---
# Slide Header

This slide has a code block that demonstrates how to square an integer x. The output is shown in raw text.

```{r, results='asis'}
x <- 15
x ** 2
```

--

You can also add additional text to the same slide with two dashes. What is today's date?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Sys.Date()
```

---

# Math Slide

You can also render LaTeX expressions in your presentation.

$$P(X) = \int_0^\infty xf_X(x)dx$$
--

And plot graphs!

```{r, out.width = '220px', fig.align='center'}
x <- seq(-5, 5, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)

plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
```
